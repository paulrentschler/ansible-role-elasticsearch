# Define the index settings
#
# Note: for development it makes sense to "disable" the distributed features:
#    shards: 1
#    replicas: 0
#
# These settings directly affect the performance of index and search operations
# in your cluster. Assuming you have enough machines to hold shards and
# replicas, the rule of thumb is:
#
# 1. Having more *shards* enhances the _indexing_ performance and allows to
#    _distribute_ a big index across machines.
# 2. Having more *replicas* enhances the _search_ performance and improves the
#    cluster _availability_.
#
# The "shards" is a one-time setting for an index.
#
# The "replicas" can be increased or decreased anytime,
# by using the Index Update Settings API.
#
# ElasticSearch takes care of load balancing, relocating, gathering the
# results from nodes, etc. Experiment with different settings to fine-tune
# your setup.

  shards: 1

# ElasticSearch performs poorly when JVM starts swapping,
# you should ensure that it _never_ swaps.

# Firewall settings
#
# If the host supports the Ubuntu FireWall (UFW), these settings can be used
# to allow access to the ElasticSearch server and to replicate to other
# ElasticSearch servers through the firewall.
